# music-recommender
**This project is no longer in development and was only made for my personnal enjoyment**
A small app making use of spotify's API to browse and play music. It uses the API to browse genres, playlist from those genres and finally tracks from the playlists. You can then like tracks, which will trigger another REST call to get recommendations based on those likes. Due to the nature of the app and the fact that I want as many people to see the app as possible, authentication was left at a very basic level. This results in having only 30 seconds previews instead of whole songs, when the previews are available at all.

**Please note that as of now, the app is only developped to be used on a desktop screen.**

# Development roadmap
** This is no longer an ongoing project, but here are the things I would've worked on**
1. Change <div> for playlists and songs to <li> tags
2. Fix pause button when playing a track
3. Change favicon to something more personnalized for the project
4. Implement a search function
5. Implement a volume track
6. Make song play from clicking on the icon
7. Implement a way to include shows from liked artists
